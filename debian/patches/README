Debian dhttpd_1.02a-16.diff

a)
- Debian packaging is confusing. There are local changes and
  *.dpatch files, that can't be used at all (they don't apply).
- Probably the local changes are the "dpatch", so only pre-patch is used.
  filterdiff -i '*/src/*' dhttpd_1.02a-16.diff
  > 01-Debian-pre-patch-dhttpd_1.02a-16.patch
b)
- Debian includes changes to *.1 manual page:
  filterdiff -i '*.1' dhttpd_1.02a-16.diff > patches/99-dhttpd.1.patch

[not used. Converted into *.diff extension]
